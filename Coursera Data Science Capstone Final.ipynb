    "# Coursera Capstone Project: Find Similar Hotels\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is result of the Capstone Project of the IBM Data Science specialization on Coursera. You are free to choose your business problem, so I decided to look at a common almost \"daily\" problem city travellers have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider you've been travelling to one city and liked the stay, especially how your hotel was located. Maybe you preferred a neighbourbood a bit outside the city center where it is more quiet and some parks to go for a walk, but still there were a number of restaurants and bars nearby so you could spend the evening right next to the hotel without going back late in the evening from the city center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you want to travel to some city and not find a similar hotel by hotel standards (you don't need much more than bed to sleep and a shower), but find a hotel which is in a similar part of the city and has a similar environment in terms of venues around the hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This the problem I decided to take a deeper look at in this analysis."

    "## 2. Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "As a (frequent) traveller to a specific city you've become used to spending your stay in a certain neighbourhood, regarding the neighbourhood itself and the venues nearby. So, when travelling somewhere else you want to find a hotel which has similar venues nearby and is in a similar neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given a hotel in one city (which also defines the neighbourhood) we want to find similar neighbourhoods in some other city and then find the hotels which have the most similar venues closeby.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *question* we want to answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which N hotels (target hotels) in city X have the most similar environment compared to a given hotel (origin hotel) in city Y?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this sample analysis we'll use a hotel in New York and we'll try to find a list of similar locations to stay in Toronto. We'll just list the hotels by similarity, so the number N of hotel is not fixed and will depend on the data and the origin hotel's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity of the environment of a hotel can help customers of online booking services like Booking.com to find not simply a similar hotel (which we do **not** look at in this analysis), but find a hotel which is similarly located, based on the venues in it's environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can help improving hotel recommendation significantly because simple hotel recommendations based on collaborative filtering or using content-based recommendations are not aware more than a simple location rating for a hotel and even no information about the environment of the hotel at all. It's probably best to combine more than one recommendation algorithm to get the best result for the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a good answer to our question we need to consider the overall general location of the hotel and it's closer vincinity. We do not consider travel time to and from the airport or similar, assuming we are doing this analysis for a longer stay, so travel to and from the hotel is not part of the comparison. We also ignore the proximity to monuments or museums for simplicity's sake.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Analytical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "We solely base our comparison on similarity of the neighbourhood of the hotel, considering a walking distance of 1000m and the close proximity of the hotel, considering a radius of 250m.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the venues in the neighbourhoods and around the hotels. These can be obtained using online APIs, which will require geocoordinates for the neighbourhoods and the hotels. We also need a list of neighbourhoods for the target city and potentially also for the origin city (from the origin citry we only need information about the neightbourhood of the hotel).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We will transform the data about venues into one-hot encoded information about the neighbourhoods and the hotels. Then we can sum up the venues by type and calculate the mean across all neighbourhoods/hotels. Using this vector the proximity of two neighbourhoods or hotels can be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting the information for the neighbourhood of our origin hotel and all neighhourhoods of the target city we can calculate the similarity of the neighbourhoods using eucledian distance and pick the top 3 target neighbourhoods. Then we go through all hotels of these three neighbourhoods and get the venues in their immediate environment and do the same by calculating the distance to the data vector of the origin hotel. We choose the top 10 results as possible similar candidates target hotels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Due to the limitations of the free FourSquare API we'll be limited to a maximum of 100 venues per neighbourhood/hotel. This should be fine for the direct comparison of hotels, but it's definitely not really enough to compare two lively neighbourhoods in two big cities. Therefore we will choose a hotel in a neighbourhood with less than 100 venues as our origin hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New York\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neighbourhood information\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the data from this link [https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/newyork_data.json] for a list of neighbourhoods and their geocoordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Venue information\n",
    "\n",
    "To get information about the hotel's closeby venues and the information about the venus in a neighbourhood we use the FourSquare \"explore\" API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Toronto\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neighbourhood information\n",
    "\n",
    "To get neighbourhood information about Toronto we use the Wikipedia page \"List of postal codes of Canada: M\". This list has no geocoordinates yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Neighbourhood geocoordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "For geocoordinates for the postal codes of the neighbourhoods in Toronto we use data from the following link [https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs_v1/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Venue information\n",
    "\n",
    "To get venue information for the neighbourhoods and the hotels we use the FourSquare API as well\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Steps of the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will follow the following sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get data about origin city (New York) and choose origin hotel\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get/Save venue information about the neighbourhood the origin hotel is in\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get venue information about the direct environment of the origin hotel\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get data about target city neighbourhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the top 3 neighbourhoods in the target city that are most similar to the neighbourhood or the origin hotel\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get all hotels from these 3 neighbourhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get the venues in immediately vicinity of each hotel in target city\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the most similar hotels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Data Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the analysis we found the following challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of venues reported by FourSquare varies a lot from city to city, their data doesn't seem to have the same quality in all cities\n",
    "\n",
    "* FourSquare seems to report only a very small number of hotels\n",
    "\n",
    "* Venue categories cannot simply be compared between cities because of cultural difference, especially the restaurant types will not be the same if you travel to different countries and surely you a more interested in a similar number of restaurants and not in having exactly the same restaurant types around your hotel. We combined all restaurant types into a single category \"restaurant\" to overcome this\n",
    "\n",
    "* Restaurants should probably be classified more coarsly like \"Fast Food\", \"Bar with Food\", \"Full blown restaurant\". We left this open, but it could have been included in the data cleanup steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are some almost duplicate categories like Gym and Gym/Training Center. For productive use this would probably need further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* It turns out that even though we have not so different cities (New York and Toronto) obviously the categories used to categorize venues are not overlapped as much as one might think. This might be due to cultural differences. To make neighbourhoods and hotel environments comparable we reduced the comparison to the categories found in both cities/neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* FourSquare's 100 venue limit makes the free API not so useful for this analysis for places that are in environments where there are a lot of venues. We picked a neighbourhood with less than the 100 venues limit for this reason. This should allow to find a reasonable similar environment. The question remains if we should have excluded all neighbourhoods with 100 venues from the target city from the comparison as well (which we didn't)\n",
    "\n",
    "* After running this jupyter notebook several times on different days and different times of the day I can see, that the result depend on the time of the day. This leaves the impression that FourSquare is not the right data source for the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "### FourSquare oddities\n",
    "\n",
    "While doing this analysis I reloaded the venues from FourSquare several times. While the overall number of results remained more or less the same, the results were so different that the neighbourhoods with less than 100 venues in New York completely changed from run to run and I had to add the filter to only include neighbourhoods with hotels because on some runs there were no hotels in the resulting neighbourhoods. Which is another oddity - the number of hotels is not anywhere close to real numbers. I was actually forced to choose a different hotel in New York to get sufficient hotels in Toronto in the similar neighbourhoods to make this analysis worthy to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I've resorted to saving the data, to have reproducible results. However this also means that this approach is unusable for a real analysis beyond this Coursera Capstone, where I would say this is one of the key finding of the analysis. Reloading the data freshly from FourSquare can be triggered by setting the variable \"refetch\" to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is Euclidean the correct distance measure to calculate the similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different way how the distance between hotel neighbourhoods could be calculated. The euclidean distance works fine and gives truly similar results. However, one might pose the question if actually \"better\" results should appear closer, meaning that if the environment of a hotel has more venues of some type the distance should be equal to a hotel that has the same number of venues of that type (Example: if there are more restaurants around a hotel it might be better to at least not increase the distance because of that). \n",
    "\n",
    "A second possibility would be to use just zero and one for \"has/has not venue of same type\" which would account better for the variety of venues around the hotel, not giving larger weight to venues with higher numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems comparing two cities - different categories\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out more complicated than expected to compare lists of venues from different cities because categorization seems to be very different from city to city. After compacting the categories in the hotel neighbourhoods we ended up with only 8 categories left to make up our comparison space for the hotels and when taking a closer look some those should have been added to the restaurant category as well. Neighbourhood comparison still had 29 categories which seems to be ok. Probably FourSquare is not the best data source for this comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is similarity what the customer is actually looking for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion of the eucildean distance brings up if this similarity is really what the customer would be looking for. This algorithm really finds a similar hotel, it doesn't find a potentially \"better\" place. For this analysis I'm simply assuming that this is what is desired. If someone picked a hotel in a quiet area the comparison will find a hotel in a quiet area, not one that is a busy environment because there are more places around. This could be adjusted by calculating the similarity differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization/Calculation of mean() instead of using sum()\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis I changed from taking the mean of the one-hot vales to taking the sums because this results in really similar to the original hotel. But calculation the mean() the differences between environments are nivellated and the distances between locations don't really reflect true similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is machine learning in this analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis doesn't use any machine learning, it is not needed for this analysis. We could probably also cluster the hotels in the target city using K-Means and then find the best matching cluster using K-Nearest-Neighbour with some tuning. However, we'd still just end up with a cluster, so we'd still need to determine the best match within the cluster.\n",

    "* We were able to achieve our goal: we developed an approach to finding a similar hotel based on the surroundings of the hotel in a different city\n",
    "* We should look for a more complete and consistent data source, FourSquare doesn't provide complete data, the data seems to vary, hotels don't seem to be well covered and the venue categorization is not really consistent between cities\n",
    "* Not all data science requires machine learning\n",
    "* I think we have solved an interesting problem for hotel booking companies like Booking.com. They also have hotel comfort similarity and a much more complete hotel database, so with this data the algorithm could be executed with much better result quality, just because there would be much more information about hotels but also because we could add a side condition of similar hotel quality as well to make the search for a similar hotel a really useful feature\n"
